# More-Exercises-Lists-12.06.2023
These tasks are more complicated and I used lists to solve them. In addition, I used loops, nested loops and if-else statements.
The program with title "RandomSentencesGenerator" is an additional project. With it, like the title says, you can generate sentences at random. 
So, enjoy it!
